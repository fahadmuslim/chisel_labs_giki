## Interfacing with Nexys4 DDR 7 segment display with Chisel

This is a simple Chisel code to implement the interfacing with the provided FPGA board with front end written in Chisel. You need to use the switch buttons as inputs to provide decimal numbers from 0 to 9 and see the number being printed on the 7 segment display.

## Tasks
 - To design a 4-to-1 decoder in Chisel using the swicthes as inputs and the decoded equivalent displayed on the 7 segment display. XDC file for the same is provided.
 - To use the 7 segment display table used in the above task and to create a HEX up counter with the counter output displayed on the 7 segment display. XDC file for the same is provided
